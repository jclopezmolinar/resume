                JavaScript. I took on the front-end development, creating a
                visually appealing and interactive user experience, while

                resolutions and incorporated engaging animations. Throughout the
                project, I remained committed to continuously learning and
                implementing the latest web design techniques to ensure the
                website displayed as intended. The project showcased my passion
                for web development and my ability to work independently to
                deliver a high-quality product.

              <h3>CADEM Mental Workout App for Android</h3>
              <p>
                I built an Android application from the ground up using Dart and
                Flutter. The app provided users with a range of mental skill
                improvement workouts, and I worked closely with the client to
                ensure its functionality and user experience met their
                requirements. Through the project, I gained valuable insights
                into the software development process, taking on every phase of
                the project independently. I also demonstrated my ability to
                work collaboratively, eliciting requirements from the client and
                incorporating feedback throughout the development process. The
                project allowed me to expand my skill set and knowledge in
                software development while producing a successful and
                high-quality product.
